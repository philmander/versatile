## New Podcast: Phil and Bart's Extreme Adventures (in Modern Software Engineering)

[Bart den Haak](https://www.movingtheneedle.com/about) and I first worked together, I guess, about 10 years ago at Backbase. And I brought Bart in. during my time at Harver, as a software engineering coach where he did amazing things, improving the way we worked as a team and made our software.

When we get together we have that connection where we can talk and talk about building software or organizations that build software. So we thought it would be a good idea to record it and share our discussions with the world!

The podcast is called [Phil and Bart's Extreme Adventures (in Modern Software Engineering)](https://anchor.fm/extreme-adventures), but I prefer just "Extreme Adventures" for short. In the first episode we discuss what "agile" really means in 2022:
